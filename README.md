# Myocardial_infraction_prediction 
A machine learning-based project for predicting the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) using patient health data. This project aims to assist in early detection and preventative measures by analyzing medical indicators.

***
# Prediction model
   - Random forest Algorithm
***
# üöÄ Usage
1.Prepare the dataset (ensure the CSV or data file is in the correct folder).

2.Run the main script:

//bash
(python app.py)

3.Follow the prompts or view the results in the output/log file or UI (if available).

Sample usage in notebook or command line will be added here.
